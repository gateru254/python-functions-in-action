# Python Functions in Action ðŸš€

Welcome to **Python Functions in Action**! This repository is designed to help you master Python functions with hands-on exercises.

---
- A Jupyter Notebook with **Level 1 function exercises** and their solutions.
- Covers basic to intermediate function concepts.
- Includes topics such as:
  - Function definitions
  - Arguments and return values
  - Arithmetic operations
  - List manipulation
  - Mathematical calculations

---
 - For instance this are sample questions 

1. **Solve a quadratic equation**  
   - Formula: `axÂ² + bx + c = 0`  
   - Write a function `solve_quadratic_eqn` to compute the solution set.  

2. **Print list items**  
   - Declare a function `print_list` that takes a list as a parameter and prints each element.  

3. **Reverse a list**  
   - Declare a function `reverse_list` that takes an array and returns the reversed array (using loops).
